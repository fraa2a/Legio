# Phase 07: Linux compatibility and OFLL

## Status

In Progress

## Canonical requirements

Owns `PLAN.md` sections 3, 25, 26, and 28.

## Objective

Run supported Windows games on Linux through explicit compatibility configuration and reproduce the required Online Fix Linux Launcher behavior in Rust.

## Scope

Runner discovery and management, prefixes and runtime configuration, launch options, process handling, diagnostics, and an evidence-backed responsibility parity matrix.

## Milestones and principal tasks

### 07A: Runner discovery and basic launch

Status: Proton, GE-Proton, and Wine inventory is implemented; launching a game through the selected runner remains.

- Discover Proton, GE-Proton, and Wine installations.
- Validate runner paths and versions.
- Launch one supported Windows game through the Phase 06 lifecycle.

Runner inventory is backend-only at this point. Linux scanning checks each canonical Steam root in the existing default-root order, then its custom `compatibilitytools.d` directory, followed by the `steamapps/common` directory for that root and its configured libraries. Repeated roots and runner paths are deduplicated. Proton candidates need a Proton-named directory and an executable `proton` entrypoint. Wine discovery checks `wine`, then `wine64`, in PATH order and accepts only a successful version response. Discovery is separate from game catalog scanning.

Verification: available runners are detected without false success and a basic Windows-game launch reaches the actual game process on Linux.

### 07B: Compatibility configuration

- Manage runners, defaults, game overrides, prefixes, and custom paths.
- Support Steam Runtime, environment variables, DLL overrides, arguments, and working directory.
- Support Steam startup, overlay, graphics, WineD3D, and Wayland options where canonical requirements allow.
- Preserve process handling and actionable diagnostics.

Verification: each supported setting changes the observable launch environment, invalid combinations fail before launch, and diagnostics identify the applied configuration.

### 07C: OFLL parity matrix

- Record the exact upstream Online Fix Linux Launcher revision under review.
- Map each required behavior to Legio ownership and evidence.
- Cover debug logs, shortcuts, icons, and supported game or fix behavior.
- Mark unsupported or intentionally excluded behavior explicitly.

Verification: every required upstream responsibility has a Rust implementation and an exercised scenario, or an approved documented exclusion.

## Dependencies

Phase 06 supplies the shared launch lifecycle, sessions, process tracking, and diagnostics contract.

## Completion criteria

Runner discovery and configuration are reliable, supported Windows games launch on Linux, failures are diagnosable, and the required OFLL capability set has revision-specific evidence.

## Open technical decisions

- Record the exact upstream OFLL revision before claiming parity.
- Confirm which graphics and overlay combinations are supportable before 07B.

## Update notes

Runner inventory is available through the `list_compatibility_runners` Tauri command on Linux. It reports validated Proton, GE-Proton, and Wine paths with version metadata. Basic game launch through the selected runner remains open.
